## Try the Game - Copy and paste this link for the download
https://tinablair.ca/games/muffin-clicker-course-tutorial/MuffinClicker_Sep2024.exe

## How to Play
Once downloading the file to your computer (so your computer has a chance to scan for viruses), double-click the .exe file to open the game. Click the muffin, the treats that randomly spawn (You'd better be quick or they'll disappear on you!), or the upgrade buttons for points. There is no win or lose when playing this game. Just click to get points and spend points.

## Description
In Circuit Stream's C# Fundamentals course, we coded C# script for a Muffin Clicker point-and-click game. This repository holds the C# scripts for this project. A player clicks the muffin button, random treats, or Muffin or Sugar Rush upgrade buttons.This game utilizes 9 C# scripts: Floating Text, Game Manager, Header UI, Muffin Button, MuffinClicker, Rotate Over Time, Treats, Treat Spawner, and Upgrade Button. I originally took this course in 2021 but I went through the course again (September 2024).

## Features
- Muffins increase by +1 per second at the start of the game, and increase as you use the Upgrades.
- To obtain points, you can: click the muffin, and click the randomly spawning (and disappearing) treats.
- clicking the Muffin or Sugar Rush upgrades will use your points but will increase your muffins per second.
- To reset the game, press 'r' on the keyboard.
